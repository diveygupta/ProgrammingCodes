LinkedList 
Implements a linked list by extending AbstractSequentialList.

ArrayList 
Implements a dynamic array by extending AbstractList.

HashSet 
Extends AbstractSet for use with a hash table. Thread safe

LinkedHashSet 
Extends HashSet to allow insertion-order iterations. Maintains insertion order

TreeSet 
Implements a set stored in a tree. Extends AbstractSet. Objects are stored in sorted, ascending order.

HashMap 
Extends AbstractMap to use a hash table.

TreeMap 
Extends AbstractMap to use a tree. Objects are stored in sorted, ascending order.

WeakHashMap 
Extends AbstractMap to use a hash table with weak keys.

LinkedHashMap 
Extends HashMap to allow insertion-order iterations.Maintains insertion order

IdentityHashMap 
Extends AbstractMap and uses reference equality when comparing documents.

Both TreeSet and TreeMap store elements in sorted order. 
However, it is the comparator that defines precisely what sorted order means.
